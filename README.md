Let's focus on a quick overview of AWS fundamentals relevant to Spring Boot. Here are the key concepts to grasp within an hour:

### 1. **AWS Core Services for Spring Boot Integration**
   - **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: For deploying and running your Spring Boot applications. EC2 instances are virtual servers that can host your application.
   - **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Often used for storing files, images, and other assets. You can connect it with your Spring Boot application to upload or retrieve data.
   - **RDS (Relational Database Service)**: For managing databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL. It’s a managed database service that works well with Java applications.
   - **Elastic Beanstalk**: A platform as a service (PaaS) that allows you to deploy and scale web applications. It can automatically handle deployment, load balancing, scaling, and monitoring.

### 2. **Basic AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)**
   - Roles, permissions, and policies are essential to grant secure access to AWS resources in your application.
   - Create roles for your EC2 instances or Lambdas to securely interact with S3, RDS, etc.

### 3. **Connecting Spring Boot to AWS Services**
   - **AWS SDK for Java**: This is essential for interacting with AWS services directly in your Spring Boot application.
   - **Spring Cloud AWS**: A library that simplifies the integration of AWS services with Spring Boot. It provides easy configurations for S3, SQS, and more.

### 4. **Key Concepts in AWS for Interviews**
   - **Scaling and Load Balancing**: AWS offers Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancers to manage traffic and handle application scalability.
   - **Monitoring with CloudWatch**: Essential for tracking application performance and setting up alerts.
   - **Serverless with AWS Lambda**: Useful for implementing functions and integrating microservices.

### 5. **Deploying a Spring Boot App on AWS (Quick Setup)**
   - Try deploying a basic Spring Boot app using Elastic Beanstalk or EC2. Elastic Beanstalk is the quickest route with fewer configuration steps.

### Resources
   - **AWS Console**: Try launching an EC2 instance or S3 bucket to get hands-on experience.
   - **Spring Initializr**: Create a basic Spring Boot app, integrate it with the AWS SDK, and try connecting to S3 or RDS.
