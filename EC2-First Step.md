Once an EC2 instance is created, you can view various details about it in the AWS Management Console or access the information programmatically. Here’s a breakdown of each aspect:

### 1. **Instance Details**
   - **Instance ID**: Unique identifier for the instance.
   - **Instance Type**: The size and configuration (e.g., t2.micro, m5.large) that define CPU, memory, and network capacity.
   - **AMI ID**: The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID used to launch the instance.
   - **Launch Time**: Timestamp indicating when the instance was launched.
   - **Availability Zone**: Specifies the data center within the region where the instance is running.

### 2. **Security**
   - **Security Groups**: Virtual firewalls assigned to instances to control inbound and outbound traffic.
     - Security groups define allowed protocols, ports, and IP address ranges.
   - **Key Pair**: A key pair (public/private key) is required for secure SSH access to the instance.
   - **IAM Role**: Specifies an IAM role that the instance assumes for secure access to AWS resources like S3, RDS, or DynamoDB.

### 3. **Storage**
   - **Root Volume**: The primary storage associated with the instance. It’s typically an EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume attached at launch.
   - **Additional Volumes**: You can add extra EBS volumes or instance store volumes (ephemeral storage).
   - **Volume Type**: EBS volume types include General Purpose SSD (gp2/gp3), Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1/io2), or Magnetic (standard), each with different performance characteristics.
   - **Size**: Indicates the allocated storage size for each volume.

### 4. **Networking**
   - **Private and Public IP**: Each instance has a private IP for internal communication and may have an optional public IP for external access.
   - **Elastic IP**: You can associate a persistent public IP with an instance to retain the IP address even after stopping and starting the instance.
   - **VPC and Subnet**: The Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and subnet in which the instance resides.
   - **Network Interface**: Each instance has an associated ENI (Elastic Network Interface) containing its network configuration.

### 5. **Status**
   - **Instance State**: Status of the instance, such as `pending`, `running`, `stopping`, `stopped`, or `terminated`.
   - **System Status Checks**: Verifies that the instance’s underlying host hardware and networking functions are operating correctly.
   - **Instance Status Checks**: Checks that the EC2 instance is operating as expected and isn’t experiencing issues with connectivity or hardware.

### 6. **Monitoring**
   - **CPU Utilization**: Tracks CPU usage over time.
   - **Disk and Network IO**: Tracks data transfer in/out and storage performance.
   - **Memory and Custom Metrics**: While not enabled by default, you can set up custom metrics like memory usage with CloudWatch.
   - **Alarms**: You can configure CloudWatch alarms to notify you when metrics exceed specified thresholds (e.g., CPU usage > 80%).

### 7. **Tags**
   - **Key-Value Pairs**: Tags are user-defined metadata associated with the instance. Typical tags include `Name`, `Environment` (e.g., Production or Development), `Owner`, and `Cost Center`.
   - Tags help you organize, filter, and track resources within the AWS console.

### Accessing This Information
1. **AWS Console**: Go to **EC2 Dashboard > Instances** and select your instance. You’ll see tabs for **Details**, **Security**, **Networking**, **Storage**, **Monitoring**, and **Tags**.
2. **AWS CLI**: You can use the `describe-instances` command to view all instance details. For example:
   ```bash
   aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids i-0abcd1234efgh5678
   ```
3. **AWS SDK for Java**: Use the EC2 client to programmatically retrieve instance details, security settings, and monitoring data.
